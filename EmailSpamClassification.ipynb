    "##2.2. Pre-processing E-Mail Body\n",
    "Before starting on a machine learning task, it is usually insightful to take a look at examples from the dataset. The figure below shows a sample email that contains a URL, an email address (at the end), numbers, and dollar\n",
    "amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"email.png\" width=\"700px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "While many emails would contain similar types of entities (e.g., numbers, other URLs, or other email addresses), the specific entities (e.g., the specific URL or specific dollar amount) will be different in almost every\n",
    "email. Therefore, one method often employed in processing emails is to “normalize” these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we could replace each URL in the\n",
    "email with the unique string “httpaddr” to indicate that a URL was present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `processEmail` below, we want to implement the following email preprocessing and normalization steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower-casing**: The entire email is converted into lower case, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stripping HTML**: All HTML tags are removed from the emails. Many emails often come with HTML formatting; we remove all the HTML tags, so that only the content remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing URLs**: All URLs are replaced with the text “httpaddr”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Email Addresses**:  All email addresses are replaced with the text “emailaddr”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Numbers**: All numbers are replaced with the text “number”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Dollars**: All dollar signs ($) are replaced with the text “dollar”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word Stemming**: Words are reduced to their stemmed form. For example, “discount”, “discounts”, “discounted” and “discounting” are all replaced with “discount”. Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so “include”, “includes”, “included”, and “including” are all replaced with “includ”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removal of non-words**: Non-words and punctuation have been removed. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of these preprocessing steps is shown in the figure below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"email_cleaned.png\" alt=\"email cleaned\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "While preprocessing has left word fragments and non-words, this form turns out to be much easier to work with for performing feature extraction.\n",

Additionally, many of the pre-processing steps we do here are fairly common and a really simple web search can give answers to most of these.

    "t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a **two or three-dimensional map**. It is based on Stochastic Neighbor Embedding originally developed by Sam Roweis and Geoffrey Hinton, where Laurens van der Maaten proposed the t-distributed variant. It is a **nonlinear** dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data **for visualization** in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability.\n",

    "Although t-SNE is a tool used in Descriptive Data Analysis, I put it up in a separate section since it is a Machine Learning algorithm and also, there are many similar algorithms which are used to create such visualizations. Eg. Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU), Autoencoders, Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE) etc. Though a problem with many such algorithms such as MVU, LLE are that they don't work well on real life datasets (Autoencoders work really well though.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But a lot of people just consider t-SNE as a magic blackbox and interpret it in a grossly incorrect manner. [This website](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) explains the mis-interpretations of t-SNE very well and how to correctly understand what the visualization means.\n",
